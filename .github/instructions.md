you have to write selenium + java code
It should use the existing folder structure to place functions / locators
I would be using MCP server to show scenario
feel free to add more scenario 
do not create summary file after the task is done as i have less time
create only 2-3 critical scenarios related to that section with 1/2 priority
make sure there are assertions to validate 
Also try to add those kind of assertions which can fail across various devices / os / browser versions
i have less time so speed is everthing
focus is on end to end scenario
refer the current repo here 
avoid thread.sleep we can use explict wait or fluent wait may be

i dont want you to create any ps1 or batch runner file
