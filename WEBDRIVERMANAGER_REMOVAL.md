# WebDriverManager Removal Summary

## What Was Removed
WebDriverManager has been completely removed from the project as it's no longer needed in Selenium 4+.

## Changes Made

### 1. Maven Dependencies (pom.xml)
- Removed `webdrivermanager.version` property
- Removed WebDriverManager dependency
- Added `commons-io` dependency (was missing and needed by SeleniumUtils)

### 2. WebDriverFactory.java
- Removed WebDriverManager import
- Removed all `WebDriverManager.setup()` calls for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- Selenium 4+ automatically manages driver binaries, so manual setup is not required

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to remove WebDriverManager reference
- Updated `SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
- Updated `README.md` troubleshooting section

## Benefits
1. **Simplified Dependencies**: One less dependency to manage
2. **Modern Selenium**: Uses Selenium 4+ built-in driver management
3. **Automatic Updates**: Driver binaries are automatically downloaded and managed
4. **Reduced Complexity**: No need for manual driver setup calls

## Compatibility
- ✅ Selenium 4.34.0+ automatically handles driver management
- ✅ Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari drivers are automatically managed
- ✅ Both local and BrowserStack execution remain unchanged
- ✅ All existing tests continue to work without modification

## Migration Notes
For future projects, WebDriverManager is not needed when using:
- Selenium 4.6.0+ (has built-in driver management)
- Recent browser versions (Chrome 109+, Firefox 108+, Edge 109+)

The framework now uses the modern Selenium approach for driver management.
